              Only my second novel on the list by a female author, as we know women are not well appreciated in the sci-fi genre, it was important for me to mention this outstanding author, Ursula who breaks the stereotype of science-fiction being a male oriented domain.
              <br> The book deals with issues of gender crisis and identity. The characters of this story are gender-less with conflicting human characteristics. Ursula has portrayed this unique plot magnificently. This novel will give you goosebumps.
